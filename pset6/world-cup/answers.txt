Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
None of the predictions proved incorrect as the number of simulations increased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses. After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
The point at which the predictions are considered "good enough" would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the task. However, based on the simulations, an acceptable point might be around 1000 simulations, where the predictions start to stabilize and provide a reasonable estimate of the probabilities.
